FEATURE COMPLETION STATUS:
--------------------------
Total Features: 200
Completed: 0
Remaining: 200

Features in feature_list.json are ready to be implemented sequentially.

NEXT STEPS FOR FUTURE AGENTS:
-----------------------------

1. PRIORITY: Install dependencies and verify setup
   - Run: cd server && npm install
   - Run: npm install (in root for frontend)
   - Run: node server/init-db.js
   - Test: Start both servers and verify they run

2. Implement Core Chat Interface (Features 1-20)
   - Backend API endpoint for chat
   - Claude API integration with streaming
   - Frontend chat component
   - Message display with markdown rendering
   - Input field with auto-resize
   - Send message functionality
   - Streaming response display

3. Conversation Management (Features 21-35)
   - CRUD endpoints for conversations
   - Conversation list in sidebar
   - Create, rename, delete functionality
   - Search and filtering
   - Pin and archive features

4. Continue with remaining features in priority order
   - Reference feature_list.json for complete list
   - Mark features as passing after thorough testing
   - Commit frequently with descriptive messages

TECHNICAL NOTES:
---------------

- Frontend runs on port 5173 (Vite default)
- Backend runs on port 3000 (configurable via .env)
- API proxy configured in Vite for /api/* routes
- Database: SQLite with WAL mode for better concurrency
- API Key: Read from /tmp/api-key or VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var

IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
-------------------

⚠️ NEVER remove or edit features in feature_list.json
   - Only mark features as passing when completed
   - This ensures no functionality is missed

⚠️ Test thoroughly before marking features as passing
   - Follow the steps in each test case
   - Verify all criteria are met

⚠️ Commit frequently
   - After completing 1-3 related features
   - Before making major changes
   - At the end of each session

⚠️ Keep claude-progress.txt updated
   - Document what was accomplished
   - Note any blockers or issues
   - Provide context for next agent

CURRENT STATE:
-------------
✅ Foundation is complete and ready for feature implementation
✅ Database schema is initialized
✅ Both frontend and backend structure is in place
✅ Git repository is initialized with proper commits
✅ Documentation is complete

🚀 Ready to begin core feature development!

Next agent should start with installing dependencies and implementing
the chat interface (backend + frontend integration with Claude API).
